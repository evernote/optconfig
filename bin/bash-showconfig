=head1 NAME

bash_showconfig - Display the standard configuration resulting from given options

=head1 SYNOPSIS

   bash_showconfig domain optspec [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The standard Optconfig system provides a way to configure program execution
in the context specified by domain. Optionally the "perl" or "ruby" languages
can be specified to use those code paths.

The optspec is a JSON-serialized option specifier (see L<Optconfig>). Other
arguments are passed to the optconfig module (perl or ruby) to determine the
final configuration.
